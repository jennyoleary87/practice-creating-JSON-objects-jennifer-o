Using JSON - 3 Practice: Creating JSON Objects

Instructions
Create a JSON object representing a movie in a catalog, using various basic JSON
data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and nested objects. Then
answer questions to consider the choices you made in your code.
Scenario:
You are working for a streaming service that needs a database of movies. Your task
is to create a JSON object representing a single movie. The object should include the following details:
    a. Title (string): The name of the movie.
    b. Year (number): The release year of the movie.
    c. IsAvailable (boolean): Whether the movie is available for streaming (true/false).
    d. Genres (array): A list of genres associated with the movie (e.g., "Action", "Comedy").
    e. Cast (array): A list of objects, where each object represents an actor. Each
    actor object should include:
        i. Name (string)
        ii. Role (string, e.g., "Lead", "Supporting")
===== TASKS =====
1. Write a JSON object that meets these requirements:
a. Use at least one nested object (the Cast array with actor objects).
b. Include at least three genres and two cast members.


streaming service > movie > {title, year, isAvailable, genres[], cast[{name, role}, {name, role}, {name, role}]}

    {
        "title": ,
        "year": ,
        "isAvailable": ,
        "genres": [],
        "cast": [
            {
                "name": ,
                "role":
            },
            {
                "name": ,
                "role":
            },
            {
                "name": ,
                "role":
            }
        ]
    }
